# Git::File::History [![Test-install and cache deps](https://github.com/JJ/raku-git-file-history/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JJ/raku-git-file-history/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

Get all versions of a file in a git repository. Main use case for this is 
when you use the repository for storage, and want to examine the progression 
of some files. Or whatever. I don't really know, it was an itch I had to 
scratch and here we are.

## Installing

Usual way:

    zef install Git::File::History

## SYNOPSIS

```raku
use Git::File::History;

my $file-histories = Git::File::History.new();
say $file-histories.history-of( "README.md");

for $file-histories.history-of( "t/01-basic.t") -> $fv {
   say $fv.date, " â†’ ", $fv.state.split("\n").elems;
}

# Repo in another directory:
my $file-histories' = Git::File::History.new( "another/dir" );
```
